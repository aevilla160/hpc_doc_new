# Introduction to OOD

We are happy to introduce Open OnDemand (OOD) support for Pinnacles and MERCED Clusters!

## Accessing OOD 
To access Open OnDemand please access using the following link: [https://ondemand.rc.ucmerced.edu](https://ondemand.rc.ucmerced.edu)

The Login page will require you to authenticate with your username and password that were given to the user by the CIRT team. Typically the username will be the same as your UCM NetID, but the password will be a password that you chose. 

Open OnDemand is a web front‑end that lets you interact with both the **Pinnacles** and **MERCED** clusters without having to interact with command line. Think of it as an HPC “control center” — upload files, open a shell, launch Jupyter Lab or VS Code, monitor jobs, and even check your disk usage, all from a browser.

## Logging into the Web GUI
>  **URL:** [https://ondemand.rc.ucmerced.edu](https://ondemand.rc.ucmerced.edu)  
> **When:** Service goes live in late April / early May 2025.

:::warning
For users logging into for the first time, please sign in via the terminal, showcased here, to properly reset the default password.

## Showcase: Launching Jupyterhub

![Jupyter](./imgs/ood_jupyter_setup.png)
Jupyter is one supported that is via interactive session where the user can try run Python code with different custom and personalized Anaconda environments interactively and not have worry about setting up SLURM submission scripts and get results back in real time. 

:::warning
Ensure to end the interactive session by clicking `Delete`. Example Screenshot is below
![Example Output](./imgs/OOD_Delete_Int_job.png)
Once the job is done it will enter the `Complete` state.

## Showcase: Launching Matlab
Matlab is one supported that is via interactive session where the user can try run matlab code interactively and not have worry about setting up SLURM submission scripts and get results back in real time.
